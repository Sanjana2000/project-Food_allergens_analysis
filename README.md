# Project Description :

This project aims to investigate the prevalence and severity of allergens in the US, and identify potential demographic biases that may exist. Specifically, we will analyze the impact of age, gender, and race on allergen severity, and compare severity grades across different demographics. Additionally, we will examine the break down of different food allergens per capita and identify the most common food allergens in the US. The insights gained from this study can help identify areas for improvement in allergy treatment and management, and ultimately improve the quality of life for individuals with allergies. 

# Overview
The following is the data from our API, which can be utilized to search for a particular food item. In this instance, we have entered "meatloaf" as the search query, and the resulting output prompts the user to select the type of meatloaf they wish to evaluate from the available options.


# Hypothesis
There may be a correlation between demographic factors such as age, gender, and race and the severity of allergic reactions to different types of allergens. Additionally, the prevalence and severity of specific allergens may vary based on demographic factors.
To test these hypotheses, we will collect and analyze data on allergen severity grades, demographic factors such as age, gender, and race, and the prevalence of different food allergens in the US. We will use statistical methods such as bar chart and pie chart to tests and examine the relationships between these variables.

## Targeted Questions
What Are the Most Common Food Allergies in The United States? - Is there a (gender/race) bias when it comes to allergen severity? - Does the year of birth affect the severity of allergens? - What is the breakdown of different food allergens per capita?
